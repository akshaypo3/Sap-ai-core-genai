              Business Responsibility and Sustainability Reporting (BRSR) is an
              integrated reporting framework. Its purpose is to increase the
              level of reporting on environmental, social, and governance (ESG)
              performance. BRSR requires enterprises to report ESG performance
              indicators to ensure that they practise responsible business and
              achieve sustainable development.
